      In the game week proceeding the death of Pope Francis, the Old Speckled Men were mourning the absence of their own
      Head of State against Revolution in a mid table battle of mediocrity. Left rudderless by the absence of Kieran Karolak
      (rumoured to be on a pilgrimage to the Vatican) Steven Harrington, with his own links to the nefarious side of
      Catholicism, duly stepped up to the plate and chaos ensued.<br /><br />
      ‘Smite me, oh Mighty Smiter’ screamed David Cornell, pulling up with an Achilles injury mere minutes before the game.
      ‘Judas! Judas! Judas!’ yelled the Revo faithful, Nick Chew playing the role of pantomime villain. Speckles kicked off
      and dominated from the start. Chew was unusually wasteful in front of goal, perhaps distracted by his own Mary
      Magdalene watching on from the stands. Josh Carubia was the one to break the deadlock, 1-0.<br /><br />
      Chew then came in to his own, completing a hat trick from Ben Thomson and Syf Gordon (2). The satanic goalkeeper
      suddenly afraid of crosses. Revolution pulled one back before Chew added his fourth, thumping his chest where the
      sacred Hen lies, any chance of resurrecting a move back to Revs as dead as Francis himself.<br /><br />
      The self proclaimed Archbishop of Banterbury, Joel Rafferty, received a second yellow for preventing the keeper taking
      a fee kick and was duly sent packing by the referee. ‘Speckles, wherever you may be, keep your wife from Joel
      Rafferty’ laughed the Speckles faithful as the centre back sidled up to Chew’s flame in the stands with 20 minutes to
      go. All that remained was for Revs to score a consolation and Gordon to score from a Joe Chagas assist. Chagas would
      later regret contributing, last seen being led to the toilets by Father Harrington as a reward. Speckles 6 - 2
      Revolution.
